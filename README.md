# stl-to-desmos
Upload an STL file for viewing in Desmos

Copying and pasting the Javascript into the console should allow the user to click the "Sign Up" button in the upper right corner of Desmos and upload an STL file.

Right now, the only checks are simple orthogonality checks in the STL data, so it is only capable of parsing very simple objects (planes, cubes, etc).  I plan on building this out in the near future to deduce more complex geometry.
